Synchronizing multiple EEG systems is one of the biggest challenges of doing hyperscanning (multiple person imaging/electrophysiology). I came up with a simple and efficient solution: a simple Arduino circuit that sends three logical 1's to (1) the parallel ports of multiple EEG systems, (2) the audio recording, and (3) the audio channel of the camera. This ensures that all the systems are synchronized. The delays between the pulses are of 4Âµs (negligible). You can see the basic circuit here:
