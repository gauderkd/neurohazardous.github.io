Projects aims to identify people based on patterns of brain connectivity (as indexed by MEG) using Deep Learning and other methods 

## Status
On going - Currently building the neural network and experimenting with other, more simple algorithms

## Supervisors
[Dr Bratislav Misic](https://www.mcgill.ca/neuro/research/researchers/bratislav-misic) and [Dr Sylvain Baillet](https://www.mcgill.ca/neuro/research/researchers/baillet) at the Montreal Neurological Institute

## Skills developed
* Deep learning using Keras (Python library)
* Bash programming language 
* Big data (> 150 MEG datasets)
* Advanced Signal Processing, specifically focused for MEG data using Brainstorm (MATLAB environment)
* Basic structural MRI processing (using FreeSurfer)

## Output
I am still going through the data sets and building a classifying algorithm. All the code can be found [here](https://github.com/neurohazardous/megFingerprinting)
