Toning is a music therapy technique where people are encouraged to maintain open vowel sounds to regulate their breathing and manage anxiety/stress. Nevertheless, its physiological implications are very unclear. My task in this project was to find a way to control participants breathing for experimental purposes (the experimental design used in this project tried to dissociate breathing from heart rate responses). I did so by creating software in Max/MSP that (1) takes in a given breathing pattern and presents it using an animated circle and (2) synchronized multiple streams of data (EEG, audio...)

## GitHub Repository
You can find it [here](https://github.com/neurohazhttps://github.com/neurohazardous/toning)

## Status
Done (in terms of the sofware development part) - The physiology data (EKG, breathing rates...) has been [published](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-017-07171-2). We still have to analyze and process both qualitative (interviews) and EEG data. 

## Supervisors
[Dr Alexandre Lehmann](https://www.mcgill.ca/ent/about-us/people/faculty/dr-alexandre-lehmann), [Dr Nicolo Bernardi](http://www.psych.mcgill.ca/labs/mcl/Nicolo_Bernardi.htm), and [Dr Shelley Snow](https://www.psychologytoday.com/ca/therapists/shelley-snow-montreal-qc/305696)

## Skills developed
* Software development using Max/MSP
* Developping an experimental protocol
* Research methods
* Writing code that needs to run smoothly without my intervention
