Toning is a music therapy technique where people maintain open vowel sounds to regulate their breathing and manage anxiety/stress. Nevertheless, its physiological implications are very unclear. My task in this project was to find a way to control participants' breathing for experimental purposes (the experimental design used in this project tried to dissociate breathing from heart rate responses). I did so by creating software in Max/MSP that (1) takes in a given breathing pattern (time series) and presents it using an animated circle and (2) synchronizes multiple streams of data (EEG, audio...)

## GitHub Repository
You can find it [here](https://github.com/neurohazhttps://github.com/neurohazardous/toning)

## Status
Done (Sofware development part) - The physiology data (EKG, breathing rates...) has been [published](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-017-07171-2). We still have to analyze and process both qualitative (interviews) and EEG data.

## Skills developed
* Software development using Max/MSP
* Developping an experimental protocol
