My masters thesis project aims to determine a mapping of the neural substrates of social interaction, as indexed by EEG, while two pianists play with each other. Following [research preivously published from our lab](http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2017/05/02/1617657114.short), we also gather video movement data from our participants to determine if our experimental manipulation is working or not

## GitHub Repository
You can find it [here](https://github.com/neurohazardous/hyperMusic)

## Status
On going - Finishing up data acquisition and in the middle of data analysis

## Supervisor
[Dr Laurel Trainor](https://trainorlab.mcmaster.ca/people/ljt) at the [McMaster Institute for Music & the Mind](https://mimm.mcmaster.ca/)

## Skills developed
* Advanced signal processing, specifically focused on EEG data using EEGLAB, Fieldtrip (both MATLAB environments), and Python's MNE
* Implementation of Information Theory algorithms using Python's Numpy and SciPy 
* Basic processing of movement data using [Optical Flow Analysis](https://www.cefala.org/FlowAnalyzer/)
* High performance computing using Compute Canada
* Participant management 

## Output
I am in the middle of data analysis. All the code can be found [here](https://github.com/neurohazardous/hyperMusic)
