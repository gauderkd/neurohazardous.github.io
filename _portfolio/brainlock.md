This project marked my first collaboration with [NeuroTechX](http://neurotechx.com/). We aimed to create an identification system based on the N400, a specific brain response elicited by words, or stimuli that carry meaning with them (i.e. acronyms). We flashed acronyms to participants while we recorded their electrical brain activity. Depending on what acronyms were known by the person, we were able to identify them.
