Description here

## Status
On going - Currently building the neural network and experimenting with other, more simple algorithms

## Skills developed
* Deep learning using Keras (Python library)
* Bash programming language 
* Big data (> 150 MEG datasets)
* Advanced Signal Processing, specifically focused for MEG data using Brainstorm (MATLAB environment)
* Basic structural MRI processing (using FreeSurfer)

## Output
I am still going through the data sets and building a classifying algorithm. All the code can be found [here](https://github.com/neurohazardous/megFingerprinting)
