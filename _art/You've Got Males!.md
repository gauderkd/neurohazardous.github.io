I started improvisation theatre at [The Staircase](http://staircase.org/) when I moved to Hamilton in 2016. The community quickly became like a family to me. After an intensive 6 week workshop, my peers and I decided to form a troupe: You've Got Males! Through them I've been able to better my English (my first language is Spanish), listen better, and be more quick on my feet when debating. These skills have direct translations to my day to day life: I feel more at ease speaking in public, I can communicate more clearly, and I find it easier to adapt my speech to different audiences (i.e. talk about my research to non-scientific communities).
