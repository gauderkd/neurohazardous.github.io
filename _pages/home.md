Welcome! I am Hector, a graduate student at McMaster University. Here you will find information regarding the projects I've worked on throughout my career. My background is all over the place: neuroscience, music, artificial intelligence, electrical engineering... Feel free to [email me](mailto:hector@neurohazardous.com) your questions and project proposals. I'm always happy to collaborate!
