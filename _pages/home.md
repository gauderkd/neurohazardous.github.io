# Me
I am an international student at [McMaster University](https://trainorlab.mcmaster.ca/people/orozcoph) with a variety of interests: neuroscience, engineering, music, artificial intelligence, and their different combinations. My main goal in life is to use engineering and AI solutions to translate research into real world applications, particularly in the field of neuroscience.

Here you will find all the projects I've been working on for the past few years. These projects range from the research I've done during my schooling, to some of the art-initiatives I've led and participated on. If you have any questions (or would like to work together in a project!) do not hesitate to send me a message or contact me through social media.
