We founded [NeuroTechHa](https://neurotechx.com/chapter/1528/), NeuroTechX's Hamilton chapter, in the summer of 2017. We decided we wanted to organize a Hackathon together the Hamilton tech and neuroscience community. After receiving funding from the [Ontario Brain Institute](http://braininstitute.ca/), we decided to set the date on the weekend of November 16th. The goal of the hackathon is to bring together people with different backgrounds to further develop the neurotech ecosystem in Hamilton. We encourage EVERYONE to participate, even if they do not have a programming background. We believe everyone brings something new and valuable to the table. You can find all the details and information on the [Eventbrite](https://www.eventbrite.ca/e/neurotechha-hackathon-tickets-46300938353)
