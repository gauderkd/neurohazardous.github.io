We founded [NeuroTechHa](https://neurotechx.com/chapter/1528/), NeuroTechX's Hamilton chapter, in the summer of 2017. We decided we wanted to teach a series of workshops on Neurotechnology to get the Hamilton community up to speed with what is out there in the market. This was the first workshoips on our NeuroTech101 series: NeuroDevices 101! We recently received some EEG consumer headsetes from our *awesome* sponsors (big shoutout to Interaxon, NeuroSky, and OpenBCI!) and we wanted to demo this with our community.

### Objectives
The workhop had two learning objectives: 
1. A friendly introduction to [Interaxon's Muse](http://www.choosemuse.com/), [NeuroSky's Mindwave Mobile](https://store.neurosky.com/pages/mindwave), and [OpenBCI's Ganglion](https://shop.openbci.com/products/pre-order-ganglion-board?variant=13461804483) (hardware, software, pros, cons, electrode, signal quality...)
2. How to get raw EEG data from this headsets
